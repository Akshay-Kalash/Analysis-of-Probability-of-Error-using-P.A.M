# Analysis-of-Probability-of-Error-using-P.A.M
• Designed a Matlab Simulation which simulates Eb/No values to obtain and identify the Probability of Error of P.A.M. • The
simulation results verify the Probability of Error of P.A.M for different Eb/No values.
• It analyses different conditions such as No. of symbols used and gives off a graphical representation of the same.
